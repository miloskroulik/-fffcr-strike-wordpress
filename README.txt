This plugin allows anyone with a WordPress site to join Earth Day Live with a few clicks. It is a banner that informs visitors about Earth Day Live April 22-24 and directs them to join the event.

== Description ==
# Earth Day Live

April 22 will be the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

That’s why we’re launching a massive livestream from April 22-24 where millions of people can tune in with activists, celebrities, musicians, and more in an epic celebration of our planet. [Click here to learn more.](https://earthdaylive2020.org)

## How it works & Demo

When you install this plugin and enable the Earth Day Live widget via Settings in your Wordpress admin, it will show a footer banner ([demo](https://widget.earthdaylive2020.org/demo.html)) informing visitors that your site is supporting Earth Day Live and directs them to sign up:

Then at midnight on September 20th for 24 hours, the banner will expand to be full screen ([demo](https://widget.earthdaylive2020.org/demo.html?fullPage)), showing that your site is joining Earth Day Live for the day, directing them to join:

For those who cannot shut down their website for the day, a closable overlay option can also be configured ([demo](https://widget.earthdaylive2020.org/demo.html?fullPage&showCloseButton)):

The widget is designed to appear once per user, per device, per day, but can be configured to display at a different interval.

The widget is compatible with Firefox, Chrome (desktop and mobile), Safari (desktop and mobile), Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

There are a number of ways to customize the widget in the Wordpress Settings admin section.  It provides details on what each option does.
